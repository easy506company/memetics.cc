- [Viruses of the Mind](https://www.edge.org/documents/MindViruses/MindViruses_index.html) – Dawkins’ essay exploring memes as parasitic cognitive entities.
- [The Meme Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meme_Machine) – Susan Blackmore, expands on Dawkins with memetic theory as a framework for consciousness and culture.
- [Memetics: A Systems Metaphor](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359183505050580) – Journal article on systems thinking and memetic analysis.
